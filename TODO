 * [X] Rewrite PCR/PTS/DTS after cuts.
 * [X] Fix duration (in mpv) (was missing rewrite on teletext).
 * [X] Do not write last B frames before slice (causes glitches) -> keep track of b frames -> FrameInfo.
 * [X] Correct coninuity counter.
 * [ ] Add stuffing packet after last I frame when writing
       The only mechanism (other than decoding the package) to know when the pes video data
       is finished, is the start of a new unit. To achieve this, we add a stuffing packet
       at the end of the written data (take care of count, etc.!)
       Or find another way not to ignore the last packet â€“ just feed it to the set of i-frames and hope for the best?.
 * [X] only write full pes packets (also all other pids):
   * [X] write until end if cut
   * [X] do not write until unit start

 * [X] Make reading of input asynchronous and provide method to track status.
   * [X] Show load status in GUI.

 * [ ] Save project (file + slices (frame_ids))
 * [ ] Command line parsing (for batch, project)
 * [ ] Batch processing (project + --output) for debug
 * [ ] Select pids to exclude (check at least one video + audio present, warn if not)
